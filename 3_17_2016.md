Heroku. Hosting solution for apps & webapps

Subscription levels:
FREE:  18hrs at a time running, then sleep
HOBBY:  $7.00dyno//mo      
                               -dyno = amt of work app does including processing etc.
Pros: collaborator access. Super handy, can hand off entire app to another user. Very slick hand-off. 
          Will probably hand off group projects to client using this feature.

Deploy: Heroku Git: full git functionality.
Resources : list of add ons
Metrics: website traffic data, basic metrics. 
          *Google Analytics free & includes more information.
Activity: uptime/downtime
Access: collaborators
Settings: custom domain in free version, 
               config variables: must match in connectionString
                                          can use config vars for sensetive information like keys
                                          use ENV variables.
            
              * Many addons that have key, automatically inject config vars

Add-ons

Mostly third-party companies. Most have free tier.

Examples of what Kris has in his Druids game:
“single sign-on” sign on in heroic, don’t have so log into add-on site
::Database
::NewRelic APM - metrics/monitoring (tools like this can do testing, monitoring ex: new product w/ 1000 users: can it handle that any users?)
::papertrail - request/response code including rebooting, errors. Essentially real-time. Save specific searches.
::scheduler -time-based/scheduled tasks.
::sendgrid -send email from server- not super easy bc security/spamming. Easier to use third party like SendGrid. 

::mLab MongoDB -use for personal projects

Deploying App on Heroku

•Sample project: has mongoDB
Instruction google doc on Slack. Doesn’t cover migrating data.
Terminal
•heroku create
  - add-ons on heroku website or command line:
  - follow instructions on handout
  - mongodump change ‘db’ to name of your database
  - *** move everything into ‘dump’ folder
  // cancel: figure out how it’ll work: - change db connection string to the ENV that is automatically created when new add-on made

- when applicaiton created Heroku automatically created thier branches.
- automatically deploy when::   push heroic -master

* files with sensetive information: don’t put on public git!!! or put in .gitignore
